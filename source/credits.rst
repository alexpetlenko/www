littlegrid is developed and maintained by Jon Hall (``jon at littlegrid dot org``).  littlegrid
incorporates many ideas and suggestions from other Coherence Consultants and is actively used
by Coherence Consultants because it is easy to use and provides the features required on typical
Coherence projects.
