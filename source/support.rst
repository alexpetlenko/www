=============================================

* Please refer to the :ref:`faq`.
* When an exception occurs during littlegrid start-up it produces an exception report (:ref:`sample-exception-report`), this is useful for troubleshooting.
* littlegrid maintains an active `issue tracking <https://bitbucket.org/littlegrid/littlegrid-coherence-testsupport/issues?status=new&status=open>`_ on BitBucket

.. note:: if you're stuck, then please feel free to email the generated exception report to ``help at littlegrid dot org``
